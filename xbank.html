            <h3>Contrast Ratios</h3>
            <p>
              At the beginning of this project I read a lot about accessibility in WCAG. The first method I used to make
              the app more accessible was to design for high contrast. The lowest text to background ratio I used was
              AA+, which should only be used for text larger than 18 pixels.

            <h3>Components for Accessibility</h3>
            <p>
              The login screen has round shapes that make it unique. The purpose for this is to make it easier for the
              user to recall his or her login information, since it doesn't look as standard as many other login
              screens.
            </p>
            <p>
              Input fields have a stroke around and a sample text to indicate, that you can interact with them.
            </p>
            Buttons have a minimum size of 44 pixels so that the touch target is large enough.
            <p>
              Links are not only in a different color, but also underlined. Underlining interactive text is a convention
              that is useful to support color-blind people.

            <h3>Colour & Accessibility</h3>
            <p>
              I made sure that color is not the only channel to convey important information. In this exmple red was
              used intentionally to show people that the money was spent. But visually impaired people are also served,
              because there is a minus that implies the same.

            <h3>User Interview</h3>
            <p>
              Before I started designing I interviewed four older people who regularly use a mobile phone. I asked the
              following questions:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Are you afraid of using e-banking? If so, what are your reasons?</li>
              <li>What would you need to feel more secure using an app?</li>
              <li>Have you ever had problems navigating in an app with your touchscreen?</li>
              <li>Has it happened to you that you could not read something on your phone?</li>
              <li>What are your main goals in banking that you want to achieve with an app?</li>
              <li>What were your main criteria in selecting your current bank?</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Findings</h3>
            <p>
              People of generation x are generally afraid to use mobile phone apps because there is not enough guidance.
              Based on their feedback they need more instructions and confirmations to know that they are using the app
              in the right way.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is also the tendency that they are farsighted. One of my participants can only use his cell phone
              with reading glasses. Men in particular often use a writing aid because they find it difficult to operate
              a touch screen with their large fingers.
            </p>
            <p>
              The main reason why they would want to use e-banking is because they want to be more independent and have
              the possibility to send money to their children.

        <h2>Typography</h2>
        <p>
          As a typeface I used Clarica Pro Grotesque. It is clean and has a high x-height, which makes it legible. For
          the paragraphs I used a minimum size of 18 pixels to ensure that the contrast is sufficient, even if the
          contrast ratio is only AA+.

        <h2>Color</h2>
        <p>
          The colour plaette is monochromatic. The reason for this is that I wanted to keep the app as simple as
          possible. More colours would not have improved the simplicity.
